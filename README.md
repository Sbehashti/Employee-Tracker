# Employee-Tracker
### Content Management System that organizes employee information in databases using MYSQL
#### I was tasked with creating an employee database using the MYSQL NPM JavaScript functionality, one that allows the company to add, update, and view employee names, roles, salaries, and all other relevant information for a restaurant.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, WHEN I start the application, THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role;
- WHEN I choose to view all departments, THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids;
- WHEN I choose to view all roles, THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role;
- WHEN I choose to view all employees, THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to;
- WHEN I choose to add a department, THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database;
- WHEN I choose to add a role, THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database;
